# Auto Audio Switcher

Switches the default playback device based on the focused window's monitor.

For example, if you open a media player and Win+Shift+Left/Right it over to the TV, the playback device will automatically change to the TV. Alt+Tab back to the primary display, and the playback device switches back to the speakers.
